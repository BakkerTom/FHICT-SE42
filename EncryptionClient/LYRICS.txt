Know you’re gone, I know you’re gone
But I don’t feel what I know
I know you’re gone, I know you’re gone
But my mind ain’t in control
Cause it’s my heart that’s been missing you
And it’s the heart I need to listen to
And it’s been singing songs for tender dreams
The one's you sang to help us sleep
And one day I will sing those songs
Sing them ‘till they sleep
Just like you sang to me
Just like you sang, sang to me
